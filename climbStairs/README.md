# Recursive Function Stair Climbing 
 
## Context
- You are climbing a staircase. Let's say you need to climb n stairs to 
reach the top. If you can climb 1 or 2 stairs at a time, write a function 
to calculate the number of distinct ways to reach the top. Also, 
consider that the input values (n) are always limited to integers 
between 0 and 45.

## Example
- Input: 4
- Output: 5

## Further Explanation
### If you start from the ground floor and climb up to the 4th floor, there are a total of 5 different paths
- ``` 1 step + 1 step + 1 step + 1 step ```
- ``` 1 step + 1 step + 2 steps ```
- ``` 1 step + 2 steps + 1 step ```
- ``` 2 steps + 1 step + 1 step ```
- ``` 2 steps + 2 steps ```
